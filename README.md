 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 10 or later) with npm (version 6.11.3 or later)

### Setup
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

  1. Clone the repository

  2. At the root directory, restore required packages by running:
      ```
     dotnet restore
     ```
  3. Ensure the connection strings in the below files point to the local SQL Server instance.
     ```
     appsettings.json, appsettings.Development.json, appsettings.Staging.json & appsettings.Production.json
     ```
  4. Next, build the solution by running:
     ```
     dotnet build
     ```
  5. Next, within the `\AspNet5WebApi\AspNet5.Api` directory, launch the back end by running:
     ```
     dotnet run --project "AspNet5.Api" --environment "Development"
     ```
  6. Once the back end has started, within the `\AngularClientApp` directory, perform the following commands to install the packages and launch the front end:
      ```
     a) npm install
     b) npm start
     ```
    
  7. Launch [http://localhost:7000/swagger/index.html?swagger/v1/swagger.json](https://localhost:7001/swagger/index.html?swagger/v1/swagger.json) in your browser to view the REST API documentation (Swagger UI)
